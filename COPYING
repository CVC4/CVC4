The source code of CVC4 is open and available to students, researchers,

original or modified versions; distribution is under the terms of the modified
BSD license (reproduced below).  Please note that CVC4 can be configured
(however, by default it is not) to link against some GPLed libraries, and
therefore the use of these builds may be restricted in non-GPL-compatible
projects.  See below for a discussion of CLN, GLPK, and Readline (the three
GPLed optional library dependences for CVC4), and how to ensure you have a
build that doesn't link against GPLed libraries.

CVC4 optionally links against the LFSC proof checker. See licenses/LFSC-LICENSE
for copyright and licensing information.

CVC4 by default links against The GNU Multiple Precision (GMP) Arithmetic
Library, which is licensed under GNU LGPL v3. See the file licenses/lgpl.txt
for a copy of that license.  Note that according to the terms of the LGPL, both
CVC4's source, and the combined work (CVC4 linked with GMP) may (and do) remain
under the more permissive CVC4 license.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please be advised that the following libraries are covered under the GPLv3
license.  If you choose to link CVC4 against one of these libraries, the
resulting combined work is also covered under the GPLv3. If you want to make
sure you build a version of CVC4 that uses no GPLed libraries, configure CVC4
with the "--bsd" option before building (which is the default).  CVC4 can then
be used in contexts where you want to license CVC4 under the (modified) BSD
license.  See licenses/gpl-3.0.txt for more information.

CVC4 can be optionally configured to link against CLN, the Class Library for
Numbers, available here:

  http://www.ginac.de/CLN/

CVC4 can be optionally configured to link against GLPK, the GNU Linear
Programming Kit, available here:

  http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/

CVC4 can be optionally configured to link against GNU Readline for improved
text-editing support in interactive mode.  GNU Readline is available here:
