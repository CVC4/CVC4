* [DONE] concat needs result bitwidth (ask Andy why side condition failed)

DEBUGGING:
* implement bvshl, bvlrsh, etc. side condition code
* assertion failure on starexec jobs

EAGER BB:

RUN EXPERIMENTS:
* filter all we cannot solve with lazy/eager

* run proof build as baseline: lazy/eager
* run unsat cores in lazy
* run proof bookkeeping
* run proof generation and writing to file


FUTURE TODO:
* definition expansion: now just adding assertions after definition expansion for proof purposes
* this may not be ok in general, in a way we want a "definition rule" to mimic the SMTLIB define-fun command
