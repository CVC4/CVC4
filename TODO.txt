* [DONE] concat needs result bitwidth (ask Andy why side condition failed)

DEBUGGING:
* implement bvshl, bvlrsh, etc. side condition code


EAGER BB:

RUN EXPERIMENTS:
* filter all we cannot solve with lazy/eager
* run new binary:
  * lazy_proof
  * eager_proof
  * lazy_proof_size
  * eager_proof_size
* instrument CVC4 with statistics for clauseId: glue, reschain length (in final proof), num lemmas in final proof (use a histogram stat)
  
* run on small subset
  * check proofs eager and lazy 

ANALYZE RESULTS:
* overhead of --proof:
  * eager
  * lazy
* what's the right way to measure overhead of --dump-proof?

* proof sizes (also histogram)
  * eager
  * lazy

* check-proofs (this writes to disk)


FUTURE TODO:
* definition expansion: now just adding assertions after definition expansion for proof purposes
* this may not be ok in general, in a way we want a "definition rule" to mimic the SMTLIB define-fun command
