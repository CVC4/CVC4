* concat needs result bitwidth (ask Andy why side condition failed)
* bit-blasting concat also needs output width and proper number of holes
* bitblast-eq and is in reversed order


RUN EXPERIMENTS:
* filter unsats from all QF_BV
* filter all we cannot solve with lazy/eager
* starexec script that computes the size of the generated proof and prints it to output


* run proof build as baseline: lazy/eager
* run unsat cores in lazy
* run proof bookkeeping
* run proof generation and writing to file
