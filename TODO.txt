* [DONE] concat needs result bitwidth (ask Andy why side condition failed)

DEBUGGING:
* implement bvshl, bvlrsh, etc. side condition code
* assertion failure on starexec jobs

EAGER BB:
* missing bb.PA
* add resolution proof for when added clause reduces to false (based on Minisat code)

RUN EXPERIMENTS:
* filter all we cannot solve with lazy/eager

* run proof build as baseline: lazy/eager
* run unsat cores in lazy
* run proof bookkeeping
* run proof generation and writing to file
