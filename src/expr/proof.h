/**
 * A (context-dependent) proof.
 *
 * This maintains a context-dependent map from formulas to ProofNode shared
 * pointers. When a step is registered, it internally uses ProofNode
 * pointers to link the steps in the proof together.
 *
 * It is important to note that the premises of proof steps given to this class
 * are *Node* not *ProofNode*. In other words, the user of this class does
 * not have to manage ProofNode pointers while using this class. Instead,
 * ProofNode is the final product of this class, via the getProof interface,
 * which returns a ProofNode object that has linked together the proof steps
 * registered to this object.
 *
 * As an example, let A, B, C, D be formulas represented by Node objects. If we
 * call:
 * - registerStep( A, ID_A, { B, C }, {}, false )
 * - registerStep( B, ID_B, { D }, {}, false )
 * Then getProof( A ) returns the ProofNode of the form:
 *   ID_A( ID_B( ASSUME( D ) ), ASSUME( C ) )
 * Notice that the above calls to registerStep can be made in either order.
 *
 * If the user wants to combine proofs, then a registerProof interface is
 * available. The method registerProof can be seen as syntax sugar for making
 * multiple calls to registerStep. Continuing the above example, if we call:
 * - registerProof( E, ID_E( ASSUME( A ), ASSUME( B ) )
 * is the same as calling steps corresponding the steps in the provided proof
 * bottom-up, starting from the leaves:
 * --- registerStep( A, ASSUME, {}, {}, true )
 * --- registerStep( B, ASSUME, {}, {}, true )
 * --- registerStep( E, ID_E, { A, B }, {}, true )
 * This will result in getProof( E ) returning:
 *   ID_E( ID_A( PB, ASSUME( C ) ), PB )
 * where PB is ID_B( ASSUME( D ) ). Notice that the proof of A by ID_A was not
 * overwritten by ASSUME.
 *
 * More generally, this class overwrites assumptions wherever possible, and
 * maintains a policy on when the other proof steps are overwritten. Currently,
 * no proof step (apart from ASSUME) is overwritten when provided in another
 * registerStep call.
 *
 * As another example, say that we call:
 * - registerStep( B, ID_B1 {}, {}, false )
 * - registerStep( A, ID_A1, {B, C}, {}, false )
 * At this point, getProof( A ) returns:
 *   ID_A1( ID_B1(), ASSUME(C) )
 * Now, assume an additional call is made to:
 * - registerProof( D, ID_D( ID_A2( ID_B2(), ID_C() ) ) )
 * where assume ID_B2() and ID_C() prove B and C respectively. This call is
 * equivalent to calling:
 * --- registerStep( B, ID_B2, {}, {}, true )
 * --- registerStep( C, ID_C, {}, {}, true )
 * --- registerStep( A, ID_A2, {B, C}, {}, true )
 * --- registerStep( D, ID_D, {A}, {}, true )
 * Afterwards, getProof( D ) returns:
 *   ID_D( ID_A1( ID_B1(), ID_C() ) )
 * Notice that the steps with ID_A1 and ID_B1 were not overwritten by this call,
 * whereas the assumption of C was overwritten by the proof ID_C(). Notice that
 * the proof of D was completely traversed, despite encountering formulas, A and
 * B, that were already given proof steps.
 *
 * Notice the map from Nodes to ProofNodes is context-dependent and is
 * backtracked when the context backtracks.
 *
 * This class requires a ProofNodeManager object, which is a trusted way of
 * allocating ProofNode pointers. This manager may have an underlying checker,
 * although this is not required. It also (optionally) takes a context c.
 * If no context is provided, then this proof is context-independent. This
 * is implemented internally by using a dummy context that is never pushed
 * or popped.
