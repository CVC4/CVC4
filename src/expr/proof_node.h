/** A node in a proof
 *
 * A ProofNode represents a single step in a proof. It contains:
 * (1) d_id, an identifier indicating the type of inference,
 * (2) d_children, the child ProofNode objects indicating its premises,
 * (3) d_args, additional arguments used to determine the conclusion,
 * (4) d_proven, cache of the formula that this ProofNode proves.
 *
 * Overall, a ProofNode and its children form a directed acyclic graph.
 *
 * A ProofNode is intended to be mutable in that (1), (2) and (3) can be
 * modified. An example is when a ProofNode is established to be a "hole"
 * for something to be proven later. However, (4) is intended to be immutable.
 *
 * The method setValue is private and can be called by objects that manage
 * ProofNode objects in trusted ways that ensure that the proof maintains
 * the invariant above. Furthermore, notice that this class is not responsible
 * for setting d_proven; this is done externally by a ProofChecker class.
