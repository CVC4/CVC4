/** A node in a proof
 *
 * A ProofNode represents a single step in a proof. It contains:
 * (1) d_id, an identifier indicating the type of inference,
 * (2) d_children, the child ProofNode objects indicating its premises,
 * (3) d_args, additional arguments used to determine the conclusion,
 * (4) d_proven, cache of the formula that this ProofNode proves.
 *
 * Overall, a ProofNode and its children form a directed acyclic graph.
 *
 * A ProofNode is intended to be mutable in that (1), (2) and (3) can be
 * modified. However, (4) is intended to be immutable. The method setValue
 * is private and can be called by objects that manage ProofNode objects.
