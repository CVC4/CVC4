LFSC Checker - Installation instructions

You need cmake (>= version 2.8.9) to build LFSC Checker.

To build a regular build, issue:

  cd /path/to/lfsc_checker
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make

Alternatively you can configure a regular build with

  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release


To build a debug build, issue:

  cd /path/to/lfsc_checker
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
  make
